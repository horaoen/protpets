A ledger app for pet rescue donations and expenses
## Motivation
My mother rescues homeless small animals in my hometown Huangchuan County (Henan Province). The main sources of funding are donations from well-meaning people, donations after pet adoptions, and advertising expenses from local businesses. We hope that every amount of money here will be open and transparent, so I will do a bill statistics at the end of each month to record and disclose the usual expenses and donations. The recording and statistics process is very boring , and my mother is not good at using those computer software (excel, notion, etc.). I usually record each account in excel, and then summarize it and make it public in notion.

This is our [notion bill](https://water-crest-907.notion.site/7b1ef5cc02a640e18cedaa41bdf12dfd) for the past year.
## Goals
- basic skills
   - Simplify bill entry and statistical operations
   - Make billing details publicly visible in the software
   - Functions expected to be realized in the future
     - pet adoption
     - pet Finder
     - pet rescue record
- Learn and explore the basic ability of development and maintenance of open source software
- Try to develop applications based on Spring Boot 3 and React Native, and explore a more reasonable and perfect software engineering path.

I hope there will be fewer and fewer homeless fur kids.
